# Title: Learning about databases

- Repository: `fixing-db-bugs`
- Type of Challenge: `Learning challenge`
- Duration: `1 day`
- Deployment strategy : `NA`
- Team challenge : `solo`

## Learning objectives
- Ability to fix existing code with bugs related to a database.

## The Mission
Your coach has probably helped you to fix some bugs in your code base during the training, and we think it is only fair to now return the favor.

Your coach has written [a small script](resources/index.php) that manages users and their favorite sports.

However, your coach drank a bit too much of his favorite drink (this is an excellent moment to ask him/her what this beverage is), and the script is littered with bugs.

The coach has added some comments where these bugs are, but has given up on fixing them.

Can you fix all the bugs?

## Tip
Use the debugger, he will be your best friend!
